*Possibly using a basic sprite for the planets and then generating the scenery of the planet to make the planets not as repetetive

*Different weapons for the ships, 

	IMPLEMENTATION
		-Each ship has a weapon object
		-Weapon object has a shoot method
		-Shoot method returns an array of shots
		-The returned shots can then have different directions and sprites : D
		
*Planets are collidable and you can blow them up creating debris which in turn is collidable
	-Both players and enemies can get hurt by planets + debris
	
*Unlockable ships
	-Slow beefy one
	-Fast as fuck one
	-Iron man
	
*Stars and/or planets flying by in the startmenu
